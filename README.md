Introduction
-------------

Angular uses native JavaScript methods for sorting, whereas `ngCrossfilter` uses <a href="https://github.com/square/crossfilter" target="_blank">Crossfilter</a> for a significant improvement in performance. It introduces an intuitive microsyntax for filtering which is simple to get to grips with.

Getting Started
-------------

Previous documentation is invalid due to major refactor for v1.0.0.
